# Creating New Modules
Opsdroid is an open source chatbot framework. It is designed to be extendable, scalable and simple. It comes with a few official modules that can be found in the [Opsdroid  GitHub account](https://github.com/opsdroid).

 If you love a particular platform and wish to use opsdroid with it or if you want opsdroid to interact with something in a certain way, you can create your own modules and extend the functionality of opsdroid.

 If you don't know where to start, make sure to check the overview and read the [documentation](https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/index.html).  Remember that you can also ask for help in our [matrix channel](https://app.element.io/#/room/#opsdroid-general:matrix.org)

## Creating Consistent Logging Messages

When creating log messages, we would like to see a consistency around how to structure and utilize them.

* In general any copyright/legal name should be Capitalized (i.e. Slack, Telegram)
* All usage of the opsdroid capabilities should be Capitalized (Connector, Skill, Database and Parsers)
* All sentances should end with a period.  
* When inserting specific text from an error message, end the sentance with a period.
